# InstaPay Simulation
This program simulates a simple banking system similar to InstaPay where users can register, login, check their balance, and transfer money to other users. The system supports different payment methods with associated service charges. The main goal of this program is to demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as polymorphism and encapsulation.

## Object-Oriented Programming Techniques
This program utilizes several OOP concepts:

Classes and Objects: Defined classes such as User, PaymentMethod, Visa, Fawry, and Account.

Inheritance: Visa and Fawry classes inherit from the PaymentMethod abstract class.

Polymorphism: The PaymentMethod class defines a common interface for different payment methods, and the derived classes (Visa and Fawry) implement this interface.

Encapsulation: User data and account operations are encapsulated within the User and Account classes.

Abstraction: The PaymentMethod class is abstract and defines virtual functions that must be implemented by derived classes.

## Features
User Registration: Users can create an account with a unique ID, password, and initial balance.

User Login: Registered users can login using their ID and password.

Balance Display: Logged-in users can view their current balance.

Money Transfer: Users can transfer money to other registered users using different payment methods (Visa and Fawry), each with its service charge.
